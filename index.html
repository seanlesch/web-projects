    <p>My Program 3 already featured the use of classes in its handling of the animal list, with each animal’s traits being held in a struct that was declared as a private data member 
      of the “animal_list” class. To expand on the program, I will make each animal have it’s on class, and have the list of animals be its own class, as it was before. The individual 
      animal class will have functions for changing the animals traits and matching a trait to a search term. The traits will be the same as the animal struct from Program 3,
       which included the name, species, breed, age, weight, friendliness towards children, friendliness towards other animals, and other behaviors. Each of these traits will be dynamically 
       allocated using pointers, to allow for longer traits (especially those that may be found in the other behaviors). The number of instances of the class will also be dynamically allocated 
       based upon the amount of animals detected in the animals.txt file. This will be done by writing the amount noooof animals into the file as the first element in the semicolon separated list. </p>
